Shazamify allows you to play your Shazams in Spotify, directly from the browser.

Shazamify add a small Spotify icon to every Shazam track page and allows you to play that track directly in Spotify.

##Installation on Chrome

1. Download the user script.
2. Open `chrome://chrome/extensions/`.
3. Drag and drop the folder `chrome-extension` in the browser window.

##Note
Unfortunately the Chrome Extension was dropped from the store because it used the word Shazam. Anyway the good news is that you can still enjoying it with a manual installation :)
