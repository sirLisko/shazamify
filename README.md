## Note
<b id="f1">**UPDATE 3**</b>: The *Chrome Extension* was taken down without any notice from the store. Thanks Google, thanks! I am trying to figure out what I can do about it. In the meanwhile you can use the User Script solution.

~~**UPDATE 2**: The *Chrome Extension* is back only with a new fancy name (**Zamify**), thanks coypright!~~

~~**UPDATE**: Unfortunately the *Chrome Extension* was taken down from the store because it used the word Shazam. Anyway the good news is that you can still enjoying it with a manual installation :)~~
